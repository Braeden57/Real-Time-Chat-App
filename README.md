To start open the terminal in this directory and type the following commands

npm init
npm i socket.io
npm i --save-dev nodemon
npm run devStart

the first command makes sure the directory is ready to use
the next two commands are installing some needed libraries
the last command starts the server and is ready to be accessed on your localhost:3000

you can create a room and set your username, then in a different browser or tab go to 
localhost:3000 and join the room you previously created and enjoy
